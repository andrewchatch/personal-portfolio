# My Personal Portfolio

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio website. The site is divided into three section, the Homepage, the 'Projects' section, and the 'About Me' section. The main page contains a short introduction and a link to the 'Projects' section. The 'Projects' section contains links to the recent projects that I have completed, which I update regularly so that my most recent work is always at the forefront. At the top of the 'About Me' section, you will find a personal summary, detailing my background and my goals as a developer. In this section, you will also read about my education, the technologies that I have experience using, and my contact information. I have also included a link to a web-hosted version of my resume, which can also be found  <a href="https://andrewchatch.github.io/interactive-resume" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Technologies Used
I created this site mainly using React, as well as jQuery and CSS animations. I used a HashRouter and the react-router-dom package to link between the different pages of the site. I also added some animations to different elements of the site. For example, when the website first loads, the 'Hi' written on the homepage will grow in size. (If you click on it, it will grow bigger). Additionally, on the 'About Me' page, a button that says 'Click Me' is added to the DOM once you scroll down the page. If you click it, the images in the Technology section will move around for a few seconds. The button is then removed from the DOM so the movement does not become too distracting. 

## Why I Made This Site
I created this portfolio website to showcase the projects that I have completed and the skills that I have gained as a software developer. I am currently looking for  work opportunities in software engineering that will give me the chance to grow and stretch myself even further, so if you are aware of any such opportunities, please contact me through the information on my site.
